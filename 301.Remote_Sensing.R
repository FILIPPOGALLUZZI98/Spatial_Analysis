# Important properties to consider while searching the remotely sensed (satellite) data include:
# Spatial resolution --> the size of the grid cells
# Temporal resolution --> the return time or frequency that data is collected
# Spectral resolution --> the parts of the electromagnetic spectrum for which measurements are made
# Radiometric resolution (sensor sensitivity) --> ability to measure small differences
# Quality issues --> the presence of cloud-cover or of artifacts in the data

# The Landsat program started in 1972 and is is the longest running Earth-observation satellite program

# Most remote sensing products consist of observations of reflectance data. That is, they are measures 
# of the intensity of the sun’s radiation that is reflected by the earth. Reflectance is normally measured 
# for different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, it can be measured in the near-infrared,
# red, green, and blue wavelengths. If that is the case, satellite data can be referred to as “multi-spectral”
# The data are normally stored as raster data, and are generally referred to as “images”.
