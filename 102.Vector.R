# The 'terra' package defines a set of classes to represent spatial data. A class defines a 
# particular data type. The data.frame is an example of a class. Any particular data.frame 
# you create is an object (instantiation) of that class.
# 'terra' introduces a number of classes with names that start with 'Spat'. For vector data, 
# the relevant class is 'SpatVector'. These classes represent geometries as well as attributes
# (variables) describing the geometries
