# Principal Component Analysis

# Multi-spectral data are sometimes transformed to helps to reduce the dimensionality and noise in the data. 
# The PCs transform is a generic data reduction method that can be used to create a few uncorrelated bands from
# a larger set of correlated bands. You can calculate the same number of principal components as the number of input
# bands. The first principal component (PC) explains the largest percentage of variance and other PCs explain 
# additional the variance in decreasing order.
